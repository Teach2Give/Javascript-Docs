# Running JS node.js

## Running JavaScript with Node.js

To execute JavaScript code using Node.js, follow these steps:

1. **Create a JavaScript File**:
    - Create a file with a `.js` extension, for example, `script.js`.

2. **Write Your JavaScript Code**:
    - Open the file in a text editor and write your JavaScript code.

3. **Run the Script**:
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `.js` file.
    - Execute the script using:
      ```
      node script.js
      ```

## Using the Node.js REPL

Node.js includes a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive code execution:

1. **Start the REPL**:
    - Open a terminal and type:
      ```
      node
      ```
    - This command starts the REPL.

2. **Interact with JavaScript**:
    - You can now type JavaScript code directly into the terminal and see the results immediately.
